# Side-project-2023-1st-SW
My side project for CS3. This is for the first six weeks of school.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I plan to finish a program I started a while ago; which was minesweeper. The program was
intended to solve a minesweeper board by telling the user which spot to select next, as 
well as flagging spots it believes has bombs. 

I last worked on this project 3 months ago and was left at making the part of the program that determined which squares were actually bombs. I had already created code that automatically create a minesweeper board.
